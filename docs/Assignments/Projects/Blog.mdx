# Project Two - Blog

## Ready to make your first REACT website?

Let's make a blog! You are free to include any content you want, such as:
 * Cooking advice and recipes!
 * A guide to your favorite video game!
 * A blog about your favorite TV show!
 * A blog about your favorite movie!
 * A blog about your favorite celebrity!

However, the blog will be done in **groups**. This means that, whatever you're writing about, all members of the group should be 
interested in the topic.

Unlike your first project, you'll be building this one with React.

### Setup

Only one person per group needs to go through the setup.

Create a new folder and open a terminal on it.

Then, in your terminal, run `npm init gatsby`. This will create a new React project for you.
 1. Enter the name of your blog
 2. Pick folder name (same is ok)
 3. Pick JavaScript language (NOT TypeScript)
 4. Pick "No (or I'll add it later)" for CMS
 5. Pick "No (or I'll add it later)" for styling
 6. Don't select any additional plugins (go down to "Done" and press enter)
 7. Press "y" for "Shall we do this?"

This will create a new folder, open it in VSCode.

Then, in your terminal, enter the new folder and run `npm run develop`. This will start the React development server. You should see a new tab open in your browser.

There are many ways to create React projects. The most common one for beginners is `create-react-app`. However, we will be using `gatsby`, which is a more advanced tool that allows us to create more complex websites (and publish them easily). Other tools you will see in the future include `next.js` and `docusaurus` (the one this website is build with!).

Your react components (and other assets) go in `src/`. You may create new components anywhere you want here. However, the `/pages` directory is special.
When you open your site on a given path (`site.com/path`), Gatsby will find the correspondingly named React component
in your `src/pages` directory and render it. For example, if you go to `localhost:8000/about`, Gatsby will render the `src/pages/about.js` component.
The `src/pages/index.js` component is rendered when you go to the root of your site (e.g. `localhost:8000`). If you go to
a path that doesn't have a corresponding component, Gatsby will render the `src/pages/404.js` component.

You should edit these files to change what is rendered, alongside creating new components and importing them. It is typical to create
a `src/components` directory to store your components that do not correspond to pages, but you can organize your project
however you want.

When you make a change, the development server will automatically reload the page for you.

### Github

For collaboration and grading purposes, you must publish this project to GitHub.
Only one person per group needs to create the repository (the same as did the setup).

To do so, you must create an account on GitHub (or use the one you already have)
and create a new repository.
 1. Do not pick a template
 2. Make it public or private as you wish
 3. Do not add a README, .gitignore, or license

Then, follow the instructions to **push an existing repository from the command line**:
 1. `git remote add origin https://github.com/sebitommy123/testing.git`
 2. `git branch -M main`
 3. `git push -u origin main`

Now, if you go to your repository on GitHub, you should see your code there.

Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository, then go to the **Collaborators** tab.

Since this project will be done in group, it is
